# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Project

A project demonstrating the construction and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure
Notebook 2.ipynb: This is the Jupyter notebook containing the code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
requirements.txt: A file that lists all the dependencies for the project.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the notebook.
Install the required libraries using pip.
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to train the CNN model.
Libraries Used
TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the data.
How to Run
Install Jupyter Notebook if you donâ€™t have it installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install notebook
Launch the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open Notebook 2.ipynb and run the cells to see the CNN in action.
